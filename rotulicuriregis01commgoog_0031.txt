sridus, had done the like, having required
the bailiff of the Abbot to attend the exe-

of this he produces sufficient suit. And he
alleges, that srom old time the place
where the thieves were hung . was called
the “ qualmsrowe,'' and he is willing to
put himself upon a jury of the two ad-
joining counties.

The Abbot rebuts the plea, by stating,
that if William de Criketot did make any
such execution, the same was done in
time os war3 and that if Osbert de Glan-
ville did the like, he did so in right of the
franchise of St. Edmund, inasmuch as he
and Robertus de Cokeford were keepers of
the temporalities of the ahhey, which, being
vacant, was in the King’s hands. This
record affords a striking example of the
mode in which franchises were deduced
from· the Saxon era, as well as os the per·
plexity and difficulty of so deducing them.
It also shows how firmly the Anglo-Saxon
language was retained in common use
throughout the country.
